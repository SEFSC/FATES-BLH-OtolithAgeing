This Menhaden Ageing Model provides an innovative method for automatically estimating Menhaden age using scale images. Built upon state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, it enables rapid generation of fish age predictions by simply pointing to a directory containing magnified images of scale samples.

## About

The internal workflow is as follows:

1. Raw images are first converted to grayscale such that every image pixel contains a value [0, 255]. These grayscale images are then processed using [binary thresholding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing)) image processing techniques by which all pixels whose values are above a certain threshold are set to 1 while the rest are set to 0. This allows the scale itself to be distinguished from the image background. The threshold value used for menhaden, based on trail and error, is 100.
2. Imperfections in the new masked images are cleaned up using [morphological opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_(morphology)) and [closing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_(morphology)) techniques to remove undesired background noise and capture any missed portions of the scale.
3. The contours of the masked shape are identified in order to extract the object of interest (*i.e.*, the scale).
4. The scale is then cropped out of the original image and padded to make it square.
5. The new square image containing just the scale of interest is passed to a trained custom [residual neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network) (resnet) deep learning classification model. Model output is saved to a CSV file.

Implementation instructions follow. Be sure to [set up and configure a Python environment](content/docs/setup.qmd) before the first use.

## Usage

The full model is wrapped inside a single Python script called `Scale_Aging_Inference_Script_Image_Only.py`. To execute, run the following command in a command line terminal:

```bash
python Scale_Aging_Inference_Script_Image_Only.py <img_dir> <csv_dir> <model_dir>
```

where

|               |                                                                                                       |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<img_dir>`   | (str) full path to the directory containing the scale images to process                                   |
| `<csv_dir>`   | (str) full path to desired directory to which the CSV output will be written                          |
| `<model_dir>` | (str) full path to the directory containing the trained model weights (*i.e.*, the `best_model.pth` file) |
